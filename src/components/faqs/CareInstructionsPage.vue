                    answer:"There may be some deviation between product color and picture color due to lighting problems - The product shoot happens in a very bright light which might give a darker appearance to the product",

                    question: "How do I avoid damage while washing my product?",
                    answer: "Keep the product clean and toss it into your machine - Never EVER dry-clean our products, tumble-dry or bleach them."

                    question: "How do I avoid fading on my product?",
                    answer: "Wash cold - With some laundry detergents, you get just as great results even if you wash at lower temperatures â€“ better for the environment and better for your clothes."
                },

                    id: 4,
                    question: "How do I avoid colour bleeding on my product?",
                    answer: "Products spliced with multiple colours will have a slight bleeding phenomenon, showing individuality, which is why wash care is important. Please pay attention to washing separately from other dark products."

                    question: "The pattern of the print looks a little different from whtat I saw when I placed the order. Why?",
                    answer: "The whole piece of fabric is printed with patterns - There could be a slight colour and pattern distribution that cannot be the same as the website images. Each piece is unique but the chances of that are close to none"
